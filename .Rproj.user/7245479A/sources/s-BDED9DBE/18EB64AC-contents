Description: The 'p1' package provides a comprehensive suite for advanced logistic regression analysis, 
    including functions for estimating logistic regression coefficients, computing bootstrap confidence intervals, 
    and generating various diagnostic metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Its capabilities extend 
    to visualizing logistic curves and generating confusion matrices. This package is designed to assist researchers 
    and data analysts in conducting in-depth logistic regression analysis without relying on built-in R functions, 
    thereby offering more flexibility and control over the modeling process.
