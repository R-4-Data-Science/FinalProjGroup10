# Packages for Logistics regression

The package must contain the basic functions to perform logistic regression (e.g. estimate the coefficient vector Î²

which includes the independent variables/predictors plus the intercept) and obtain different outputs from the procedure. The estimator to be computed using numerical optimization is the following:

$$
\hat{\beta} := \arg\min_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n \left( -y_i \cdot \ln(p_i) - (1 - y_i) \cdot \ln(1 - p_i) \right),
$$
where
$$
p_i := \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-x_i^T \beta)},
$$
and $y_i$ and $x_i$ represent the \( i \)-th observation and row of the response and the predictors respectively.

The package is specifically designed to perform logistic regression using numerical optimization techniques. This package offers a suite of essential functions that enable users to execute logistic regression analysis and extract various key outputs from the process. The core functionalities include:

    Calculation of Initial Values for Optimization: Leveraging the least-squares method to provide starting points for the logistic regression optimization process.
    Bootstrap Confidence Intervals: Functionality to generate bootstrap samples and calculate confidence intervals, enhancing the robustness of the regression analysis.
    Logistic Curve Plotting: Tools to visualize the logistic regression curve, offering intuitive insights into the relationship between variables.
    Confusion Matrix Generation: Enables the construction of a confusion matrix, which is pivotal in evaluating the performance of the logistic regression model.
    Performance Metrics Computation: The package computes a range of performance metrics critical for assessing the efficacy of the logistic model. These include:
        Prevalence: Measures the proportion of the response variable in the dataset.
        Accuracy: Quantifies the overall correctness of the model.
        Sensitivity: Assesses the model's ability to correctly identify true positives.
        Specificity: Evaluates the model's accuracy in identifying true negatives.
        False Discovery Rate: Determines the proportion of false positives in the predicted positives.
        Diagnostic Odds Ratio: Offers a measure of the effectiveness of the logistic regression model.

**Application of the p1 Package to Health Insurance Data**

Overview:

The p1 package, designed for advanced logistic regression analysis, was applied to a dataset obtained from the "R Programming for Data Science" course on Canvas. This dataset, named expenses.csv, contains health insurance cost information, including individual BMI (Body Mass Index) and charges. Our goal was to analyze the relationship between BMI and high insurance charges using logistic regression.
Data Preparation

The dataset was loaded and pre-processed as follows:

    Loading Data: expenses.csv was read into R, creating the data dataframe.
    Predictor Variable (BMI): The BMI values were extracted as the predictor matrix X, with standardization applied for numerical stability.
    Response Variable (Insurance Charges): Insurance charges (data$charges) were transformed into a binary variable y, categorizing charges above the median as 1 (high) and below as 0 (low).
```{r}
data = read.csv("F:/Fall 2023 AU/R Programming for Data Science/Practise/p1/expenses.csv")

#data = read.csv("expenses.csv")

# Prepare the predictor matrix X (using 'bmi' as the predictor)
X = matrix(data$bmi, ncol = 1)
X = scale(X)  # Standardizing X

y = ifelse(data$charges > median(data$charges), 1, 0)

if (any(is.na(X), is.infinite(X), is.na(y), is.infinite(y))) {
  stop("Data contains NA or Inf.")
}

# Logistic Regression and subsequent analyses
initial_beta = rep(0, ncol(X))
beta_hat = logistic_regression(X, y)

#bootstrap_conf_intervals(X, y)
plot_logistic_curve(X, beta_hat, y)
confusion_matrix(X, y, beta_hat)
Prevalence(X, y, beta_hat)
Accuracy(X, y, beta_hat)
Sensitivity(X, y, beta_hat)
Specificity(X, y, beta_hat)
False_Discovery_Rate(X, y, beta_hat)
Diagnostic_Odds_ratio(X, y, beta_hat)
prevalencegrid(X, y, beta_hat)

```
Logistic Regression Analysis:

Using the p1 package, logistic regression was performed, and various metrics were computed:

    Model Fitting: Logistic regression was applied to estimate the relationship between BMI and high insurance charges.
    Plotting the Logistic Curve: A visual representation of the model was generated.
    Diagnostic Metrics: Metrics such as prevalence, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, false discovery rate, and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated.
    Prevalence Grid: Prevalence was analyzed over a range of cut-off values to understand its variation.
    
Results:

The analysis provided insights into the likelihood of incurring high insurance charges based on BMI. The computed metrics, including the confusion matrix and prevalence grid, offered a detailed understanding of the model's predictive capabilities.

    Confusion Matrix: Revealed the true and false positives and negatives at a 0.5 cut-off.
    Performance Metrics: Showed the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model.
    Diagnostic Odds Ratio: Indicated the effectiveness of BMI in predicting high insurance charges.

Conclusion:

The application of the p1 package to the health insurance data demonstrated its efficacy in logistic regression analysis. The metrics obtained underscored the role of BMI in predicting insurance charges, thereby validating the package's practical utility in real-world data scenarios.
